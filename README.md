# Credit-Score-Analysis
The following project aims to predict the eligibility of loan applicants for credit using several machine learning algorithms. The algorithms are assessed based on their accuracy score to select the best algorithm for building a predictive model

To build the model we are implementing the following steps:-

Loading our datasets. 
1. To print the list of column names so that we can remove irrelevant column. 

2. To print out the data sample to visualise our data. 

3. Now, we will be doing data cleaning and preprocessing on our datasets. 

4. Finding missing values in our datasets. 

5. Impute missing values with mean(numerical variables) for our train and test data. 

6. Impute missing values with mode(categorical variables) for our train and test data. 

7. Now we will treat our model for outliers. 

8. Remove Loan_ID variable which is irrelevant for our model. 

9. Create target variable. 

10. Build dummy variables for categorical variables. 

11. Split train test data for cross validation. 

For different machine learning algorithms, we will do the following things:-
1. Fit model

2. Predict values for test data

3. Evaluate accuracy of model

After choosing the best model we will write test results in csv file.
